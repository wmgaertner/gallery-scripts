# What this does
Unzips every zip folder in the directory, converts png images to webp losslessly, deletes the extracted png files, then rezips the webp images (and .json) into a .cbz folder

# How to use
1. Drop the script in the same directory as your zips
2. Run the .py script. 

# Why
I download manga and wanted to reduce the amount of space they took up.
