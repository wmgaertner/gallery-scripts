# pngtowebp-script
Unzips every folder in the directory and converts png images to webp losslessly, then rezips the images into a .cbz

# How to use
1. Make sure ffmpeg and python is installed
2. Drop the two files in the same directory as your zips
3. Run the .py script. 

# Why
I download manga and wanted to reduce the amount of space they took up.
